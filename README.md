# Simple ANSI (rust)
A simple ansi library that does not include color sequences
but only cursor, screen, terminal. It gets confusing fast with
colors support built in so **NO COLORS**.

## Installation
Just add `simple_ansi` crate to your `Cargo.toml` and you are
ready to go.

## How Do I use it?
Just see the docs. Its that simple. **TODO: Add Document Instructions**
